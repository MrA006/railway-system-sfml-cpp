# Railway System with Dijkstra - SFML C++

## Project Name
**railway-system-withDijkstra-sfml-cpp**

## Overview
This project is a railway system simulator developed using **C++** and **SFML** (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). The system implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find and display the shortest path between stations. It provides an interactive interface where users can manage the railway system by adding or deleting stations and stops, and visualize the shortest path to their destination.

## Features
- **Add Station**: Users can add new stations to the railway network.
- **Delete Station**: Users can remove existing stations from the network.
- **Add Stop**: Users can add stops to a particular route, defining the journey between stations.
- **Remove Stop**: Users can remove stops from a route.
- **Shortest Path Visualization**: The system calculates and displays the shortest path between stations using Dijkstra's algorithm. The shortest path is visually represented by a blue line.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: Core programming language for implementing the system.
- **SFML**: Used for graphical interface and visualization.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Implemented to find the shortest path between stations.

## How to Use
1. **Setup**:
   - Clone the repository.
   - Ensure SFML is installed on your system.
   - Build and compile the project using a C++ compiler.

2. **Running the Project**:
   - Execute the compiled binary to launch the railway system simulator.
   - Use the interface to add or delete stations.
   - Manage stops within the network by adding or removing them.
   - Select stations to find the shortest path, which will be displayed with a blue line.
